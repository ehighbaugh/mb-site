    On January 2, 1999, 11-year-old Mikelle and her 9-year-old sister Kimber were playing outside their home and riding bikes. After the two thought they heard an ice cream truck in the distance, they went inside their home, asked their mother for money, then returned outside. At 5:50 p.m., they were waiting for the ice cream truck near the corner of Toltect Street and El Moro Avenue. Kimber was cold and wanted to go inside, but Mikelle wanted to wait and continued riding the bike as Kimber went in. Seeing that only Kimber came in, their mother immediately told her to go get Mikelle because it was getting dark and cold. Kimber went back outside, but only saw the bike lying on the ground with the tire still spinning. As she walked closer, she saw Mikelle's quarters lying on the ground. She immediately returned to her mother and told her Mikelle was gone. Police later estimated that Mikelle was only left alone for about 90 seconds.
